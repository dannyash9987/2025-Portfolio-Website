# PC Repair Project

We done another Project in Class where we took a PC and checked to see how it functioned. Below are the results of the one I choose.
- LAB-C8T45AV
- No WI-FI just Ethernet
- Powered up Computer to see if it worked.
- The root cause is where it is a older PC and WI-FI was not put into PC's back when Windows 7 existed.
